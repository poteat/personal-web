Attending the annual Slate Star Codex meetup in San Francisco's Dolores Park, connecting with the rationalist community during my first summer in the Bay Area.

I'm in SF for the summer, and I was thus able to attend the Slate Star Codex meetup this year in Dolores Park. Met a lot of interesting people, and got to meet Scott. While I'm in the Bay Area I hope to get a little more involved in that scene.

Picture is of the park, not the meetup specifically.
