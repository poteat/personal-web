This is the blog of Alice Poteat. I'm a staff software engineer at [volley](https://volleythat.com/) - where I facilitate the dreams of our wonderful product team - and help unlock our shared vision for the future of "Netflix-style" interactive entertainment.

Among my current professional responsibilities are:

-   Coding.
-   Acting as technical project manager of various multi-team confidential projects.
-   Auditing hiring, team practices, and technical architecture across five engineering teams composed of 40+ engineers.
-   Reviewing all manner of major technical decisions, especially those involving security.
-   Talent recruiting.

# education

I got a nice classical state engineering education then defected to startup land. I'm a proud alumnus of [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/) and [Tidewater Community College](https://tcc.edu/).

-   M.S. in Simulation Engineering
-   B.S. in Engineering, Minor in Computer Science
-   A.S. in Computer Science

## graduate research

In 2016, my topic of research under [Dr. Yiannis Papelis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yiannis-papelis-085633a/) was linear-temporal logic and its applications in formal verification for robotics. Is it possible to prove constraints written in LTL about a robot's behavior? Is LTL even the best formalism for specifying constraints about behavior - or could another representation be better? How can behavior be encoded in such a way that it can be formally verified, and how does that relate to the formalism used to specify constraints?

Ask me these questions and we may have an interesting conversation!

## undergraduate research

### [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley)

I was on a contract funded by Langley's distributed computing unit. This is under embargo but I can say it involved Fortran, MPI, and a lot of fun. Ask me about this too.

### [ODU Bioinformatics Lab](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/)

I worked with the amazing Dr. Jing He for two years on multiple related initiatives involving computational analysis and deep learning applied to cryo-em data. This mostly involved secondary structure analysis of proteins - one of my projects for example involved using a least squares optimization method to fit NURBS curves to volumetric density maps.

I have experience developing _Chimera_ plugins for what it's worth...

# timeline

In 2023 I gave a talk about higher-kinded types at [typescript congress](https://portal.gitnation.org/contents/the-potential-of-higher-kinded-types-for-library-semantics).

The Wall Street Journal once interviewed me about [my illicit
cryptocurrency mining operation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-of-bitcoin-factories-mining-for-the-masses-1519209000).

In 2018 Volley was featured in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/volleys-voice-games-for-smart-speakers-have-amassed-over-half-a-million-monthly-users/).

In 2017 I was tangentially involved with [autonomous catamarans](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/local/self-driving-boats-being-developed-in-hampton-roads/291-579008922).
