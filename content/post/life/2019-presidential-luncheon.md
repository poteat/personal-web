A memorable meeting with ODU's president as part of a Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society event.

<!--more-->

This last Wednesday I had the honor of attending a luncheon with ODU's current
president [John R. Broderick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Broderick).
This event was a meetup with the local Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society
chapter.

The food was delicious! We were able to talk to Broderick about current events
on campus, and suggestions we had (especially with regard to on-campus parking).

Group photo included.
